Emojicode TextMate Bundle
=========================

Adds support for Emojicode source highlighting and editing, and provides some useful tab-trigger snippets for common emoji.

_**Please note**: this bundle is rather old, and it appears that Emojicode syntax has evolved considerably since I wrote it. The syntax highlighter is thus highly outdated, and the snippets probably fairly useless. You have been warned. But feel free to hack on it yourself :)_

To install:

1. Clone this repository to your desktop.
2. Rename the folder to "Emojicode.tmbundle".
3. Double-click the file. When TextMate prompts you, install the bundle.
